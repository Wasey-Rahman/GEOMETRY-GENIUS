   <h2>1)What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
   <p>An application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents is called the Document Object Model (DOM). It specifies how a document is accessed and handled, as well as its logical structure.
    Many purpose of DOM is present.To access the document and its element in javascript,Dom is helpful.Although the DOM is not a programming language, it is necessary for JavaScript to have a model or understanding of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their constituent pieces. The document object model for a given document is made up of the document's head, tables, table headers, text in the table cells, and all other document-related components.

The name of methods are- getElementsByClassName(),getElementsByTagName(),getElementById(),querySelectorAll(),querySelector()

    <h2>3)What is event bubble?</h2>
<p>The DOM has a notion known as event bubbling (Document Object Model). The event bubbles up (or you might say is communicated or propagated) to the element's parent and grandparent elements in the DOM tree until it reaches the root element once an element receives an event.</p>
    <h2>4)What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
    <p>A callback function is a function that receives an input from another function and is subsequently called from inside the outer function to finish a task or activity.We use this because  of utilizing a callback function is that we may make another function call after waiting for the outcome of the previous function call.And it also omit the repetition of the code.And also make a small and clean code.</p>
